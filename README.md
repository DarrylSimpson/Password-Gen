# Password Generator

## Generate a random password with user input

* WHEN the user clicks the generate password button
* THEN they are met with a series of promts for password criteria

* WHEN the user is promted for length of password
* THEN they will be able to type a input of at least 8 and maximum 128 characters

* User is prompted if they want lower case, upper case, numeric , and special characters in there generated password

* WHEN all prompts are answered with at least one selected criteria
* THEN the user will have a generated password with there selected criteria

* WHEN the users password is generated
* THEN it will show up in the text box above the generate password button

## Code used
* I just used JavaScript to code the generation of the password on this page.
